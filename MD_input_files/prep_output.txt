WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 61]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 1.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. SeeNM
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 61]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.
